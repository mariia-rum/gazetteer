# gazetteer
This is a project that deals with deduplications. Gazetteer deduplication is for matching a messy data set against a ‘canonical’ dataset. The former contains misspellings, typos, leading/trailing blanks, whereas the latter must be clean and well formatted. The goal is to match records between the two sources so that each mispelt entry can be replaced  with its correct form.
